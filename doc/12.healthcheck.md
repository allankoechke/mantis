@page healthcheck Healthcheck Endpoint

This document describes the healthcheck endpoint in the Mantis project, its purpose, route, and expected results.

## Purpose

The healthcheck endpoint provides a simple way to verify that the Mantis server is running and responsive. It is typically used by monitoring tools, load balancers, or deployment scripts to check the application's status and uptime.

## Route

```
GET /api/v1/health
```

## Expected Results

A successful request to the healthcheck endpoint returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": <seconds>
}
```

- `status`: Always set to `ok` if the server is healthy.
- `uptime`: The number of seconds the server has been running since it started.

The HTTP status code for a healthy response is `200 OK`.

## Example Response

```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 12345
}
```

## Error Handling

If the server encounters an error while processing the healthcheck, it may return a `500 Internal Server Error` with an appropriate error message.

## Usage

- Use this endpoint to verify server availability.
- Integrate with external monitoring or orchestration systems for automated health checks.

For implementation details, see the `generateMiscEndpoints` method in `src/core/router.cpp`.
