@page setup Setting Up Mantis  

Getting started with **Mantis** is simple. You can use the prebuilt binaries for a quick start, or embed the source code directly into your own C++ project.

## 🧩 Installation Options

Mantis is available in two formats:

- ✅ **Precompiled binaries** for **Windows** and **Linux** (64-bit)
    - You can find them in the [Releases section](https://github.com/allankoechke/mantis/releases).
  > _Currently, only 64-bit builds for Linux and Windows are provided. Support for other platforms is planned for future versions._

- 💻 **Source code** for embedding into your own C++ application
    - See the [Embedding Mantis](05.embedding.md) guide for details.

## 🚀 Running Mantis

Once extracted, run the app like this:

```bash
./mantisapp serve
```

This starts the Mantis server on port 8000, bound to localhost. You can now access its REST API or embedded dashboard.
